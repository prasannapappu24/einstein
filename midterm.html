                        Albert Einstein was born in 1879 in Ulm, Germany. He was the first child born to Hermann and Pauline Einstein. Though he attended school as a young boy, he also received instruction at home on Judaism and violin. By the age of twelve he had taught himself geometry. At the age of sixteen he failed an exam in order to qualify to train as an electrical engineer. He remained in school and developed a new plan for his future. Einstein decided to study math and physics so he could become a teacher. Einstein thought he would be good at this because he could think mathematically and abstractly while lacking imagination and practicality. In 1896 he renounced his German citizenship. He was not a citizen of any country until 1901 when he became a citizen of Switzerland. In 1900 he graduated as a teacher of math and physics. His teachers did not think very highly of him though so he had difficulty being recommended for a job at a university. In 1901 he took a job as a temporary high school teacher and married Mileva Maritsch. The couple had two sons prior to divorcing. Einstein later married his cousin Elsa Einstein. From 1902 through 1909, Einstein worked in a patent office in Bern, Switzerland. While working in the patent office he published many papers on theoretical physics. He earned a Ph.D. in 1905.

                                    Albert Einstein's hobbies were sailing, reading and playing the violin and piano. He also wrote travel journals that are now held in the Albert Einstein Archives in Jerusalem. Einstein owned several sailboats in his lifetime. He kept one in Caputh, Germany, that was seized along with his cottage in 1933 when the Nazis took power. When he lived in the United States, he owned a sailboat called Tinnef. Einstein enjoyed reading and is quoted as saying that "Traktat" by David Humes had a big influence on him. He enjoyed classics, such as Don Quijote by Cervantes Saavedra and books with a scientific bent, including "Energy and Matter" by Ludwig BÃ¼chners and Aaron Bernstein's "Natural-Scientific Popular Books." He also read books by the philosophers Spinoza and Schopenhauer. Einstein began taking violin lessons at an early age, discovering Mozart at age 13. He was known to play for friends, in small gatherings or with his friend, fellow physicist Max Planck. Einstein enjoyed playing the violin, although opinions differ on his talent level. According to a book by Ze'ev Rosenkranz, Einstein was modest about his ability but still enjoyed playing. As he became older, he switched to piano because he no longer liked the way he played violin. Aside from Mozart, his favorite composers were Bach, Vivaldi, Corelli and Schubert. He was quoted as saying that he would probably have become a musician if he had not become a physicist.
